    <article>
      <p>I am the Henry Rutgers Term Chair in Data Science and Associate Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science at <a href="http://www.newark.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers Newark</a>.</p>

<p>You can learn about the research done in my lab through the <a href="http://shaftolab.com/">Cognitive and Data Sciences (CoDaS) lab website</a>. It includes a rather silly, rather dated picture of me at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Donkey+Hill+Cutoff,+Ellsworth,+NH+03223/@43.9067356,-71.8144929,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4cb49c1d60ed0dc9:0x746b67588aa7d0f8">Donkey Hill cutoff</a> in New Hampshire, a list of the fantastic <a href="http://shaftolab.com/people.html">folks</a> who are currently in or have moved on from my lab,  as well as a proliferation of <a href="http://shaftolab.com/publications.html">papers</a>.</p>

<p>My work is interdisciplinary and I get excited about research that is both theoretical and relevant to real-world problems. Since I have moved back east, I go into the city roughly one day a week to chat with people in industry about the problems that they are excited about. Please reach out if you want to drink COFFEE! and chat.</p>

<p>In my non-work life, I have a fantastic partner, Carissa who is always doing ever more fantastic things, as well as two children and two cats who would not be alive if not for her (different reasons!). Donâ€™t tell her, but whenever Carissa leaves, everyone is issued sharp objects to ensure they are engaged. We live in a fantastic house in the Ironbound district of Newark. Please contact me if you are in the area, we love hosting people and showing off the wonderful city of Newark!</p>

<p>Props to Clay Harmon for the sweet Tufte-style-style.</p>
